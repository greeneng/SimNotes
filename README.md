# SimNotes
Notepad editor for Cowon J3/S9 media players written in Adobe Flash CS3

SimNotes is simple text editor intended to replace standard Typist of Cowon flash-based PMPs.
It allows to create and modify up to 60 notes (up to 200 characters each) and standard Memo widget's text.
The distinctive feature is keyboard allowing typing in Latin and Cyrillic scripts with diacritic marks and additional non-ASCII letters.
It may work on Cowon's players beside J3/S9 but never tested on such. Also interface is fixed for these PMP's screen size. Of course it will work on PC with Flash Player installed.
